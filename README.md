# Project Athena

**_What is Athena?_**

Athena is a Slack bot for operations, connecting to services providing metrics and then spitting them back out as graphs or just condensed statistics.

**_What can Athena currently do?_**

Currently Athena can greet you, responding to direct messages or just listening in for keywords or service names in channels.

**_What is planned for Athena?_**
+ Slack based management of services: creating links to services, updating links to services and amending user based permissions.
+ Conversational responses to queries about services Athena is linked to.
