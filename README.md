# Project Athena

**_What is Athena?_**

Athena is a Slack bot for operations, connecting to services providing metrics and then spitting them back out as graphs or just condensed statistics.

**_What can Athena currently do?_**

Currently Athena can greet you, responding to direct messages or just listening in channels. Athena can also mock a line graph between dates and reply with a PNG image.

**_What is planned for Athena?_**
+ Slack based management of services: creating links to services, updating links to services, updating service SLAs and amending user based permissions.
+ Conversational responses to queries about services Athena is linked to.

  For instance, if you were to say:

  > @Athena is google up?

  Athena would respond in kind based on the check. For instance, if the check specified that an acceptable response time should be as long as 2 or 10 seconds, Athena would reply with that the service was operating normally - anything above the specified times would result in Athena replying with some statistics surrounding the abnormally operating service.


**_What services or checks are you planning on integrating with or creating?_**

There are a couple of services I'm currently planning on writing API calls for off the bat:
1. Datadog:

   All metrics associated with a service saved in Athena, either based on tags or hostname stored in datadog.
2. Google Apps, more importantly Google sheets:

   From Google sheets you will be able to pull out statistics from specific sheets and cells or multiple sheets and cells in response to indirect messages or direct messages.

_I have got others that I have in mind but, for the moment, these are the only two that are planned._

Custom checks I'm looking to create:
1. Ping check
2. Web site or web page response time
3. Cron style service checks


## Current to do:

**__Responses__**
1. **~~Greetings~~**
2. **Context manager**
   1. Write a function for parsing text and pattern matching for contextual information like service name, checks and or dates.
3. **Statistics**
   1. ~~Mock line graph data points between two dates~~
   2. Write function for handling and presenting single data points
   3. Write function for handling and presenting multiple data points
   4. Write wrapper for presenting data in graph format
4. **Service Checks**
   1. Write function which pings a service.
   2. Write function which requests as website or webpage.
   3. Write a ticker service for running checks over a time frame.

**_Service Integration_**
1. API Calls
   1. Datadog
   2. Google Apps

**_Database_**
1. Database connector
2. Create base database models:
   * User accounts
   * User permissions
   * Services
   * Service integrations
   * Service checks
